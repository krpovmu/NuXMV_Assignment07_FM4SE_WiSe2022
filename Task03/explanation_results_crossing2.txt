Specification  G !(carsGo & trainsGo)  is false

There are 3 states in which carGo and trainsGo can be TRUE which are in which the & operation is FALSE because it has a negation making the operation TRUE which satisfies G, but if you look at trace there is a counter example where if carGo and trainsGo are both TRUE the negation operation makes them FALSE making it not satisfy the G requirement.

This is the NuSMV result:

    carsGo = FALSE
    trainComing = FALSE
    trainsGo = FALSE

    carsGo = TRUE
    trainComing = TRUE
    ambulance = TRUE
  -> State: 1.3 <-
    trainComing = FALSE
    trainsGo = TRUE

  -> State: 1.4 <-
    trainsGo = FALSE
  -> State: 1.5 <-
